# What is Artshop
The aim of this project was to build a web application using the Microservices archicture and to deploy it in the cloud by means of the _aws_ services.
Artshop is an e-commerce web app for those who want to sell and buy artworks. An amateur or professional artist that would like to make money with his creations can sign up in the system, create an insertion and wait for someone to buy it.
<br><br>
The main features of the app are:
- Sign-up
- Log-in
- Checking if user's requests are authorized (IPC)
- Catalogue of all artworks for sale
- Sale of an artwork
- Purchase of an artwork

In this project I involved many technologies as: 
- **Node.js**: used as server application both in the backend apis and in the frontend;
- **Express** was used to build quickly the apis;
- **Docker**: employed to build the container images and push them to the ECR repository;
- **Json Web Token**: used as an authorization token;
- **React**: employed in the frontend part;
- **aws-sdk**: enabled me to use the _api_ which allows me to _read/store_ the images into the _S3 Bucket_;
- **MySQL** as DBMS.

Moreover, I used many npm packages as
